# Halifax Restaurants CAS-Project

Hosted [here](https://patrzykat.github.io/CAS-Project/)


CAS is necessary part of the IB program. It stands for Creativity, Action, and Service. 

For my CAS project, I decided to create a static website (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap) and host it [here](https://patrzykat.github.io/CAS-Project/), on Github.
